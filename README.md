About This Repository

A collection of data science projects completed during my coursework, demonstrating skills in data analysis, data cleaning, visualization, and machine learning using Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, SQL, and other data science tools.

These projects showcase the end-to-end data science workflow â€” from collecting and cleaning raw data to performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, building predictive models, and communicating results through visualizations and reports.

Each project highlights different aspects of the data science process, including:

Data Wrangling & Cleaning: Handling missing data, merging datasets, and standardizing formats

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends, patterns, and relationships using statistical and visual techniques

Machine Learning Modeling: Applying algorithms such as regression, random forests, and KNN to real-world datasets

Statistical Testing & Reporting: Using hypothesis testing and model evaluation metrics to validate findings

Communication: Presenting insights through well-documented notebooks and concise written reports

This repository serves as a portfolio of my academic work and growth as a data scientist
